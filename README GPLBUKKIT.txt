Place in this directory the GPL bukkit api files.
The directories will sort themselves out.

if you are using your own bukkit api and are on a linux distro you can the program 
rename_bukkit.sh to rename the bukkit .java files to the proper 
classnames and paths.

PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT!
You cannot redistribute the compiled craftbukkit software with the
org.gplbukkit directory contents. If you do you will be in violation of
the GPL.
Please provide your end users with seperate means of downloading
craftbukkit with wolfinabukkit and a download for the GPL bukkit api files.

You could also provide them with a 3rd download that merges the two on the clients
computer. As long as they have to download the two software packages seperately 
you will not be in violation of GPL.

One could even argue that one program with two seperate buttons to download files
could constitute seperate distribution as there are two actions involved in downloading
similar to a webpage in a browser containing two links for download
and the choice is the consumer to include the GPL bukkit api into his/her copy of the 
craftbukkit/wolfinabukkit project.
