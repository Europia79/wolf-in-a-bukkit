wolf-in-a-bukkit
================

Wolf in a bukkit is intended to be an lgpl replacement for the gpl bukkit. 
To allow programs as craftbukkit and spigot to continue to exist.

To do this we will make a program that has same classes and method names to allow  compatiblity
but the code that handles the compatiblity will be different and original.
If any of the writers of the code of the current bukkit api wish to add their copyrighted code to 
this project to also release that code under LGPLv3 that would be MUCH appriciated. 
Only copyright holder can add original bukkit api material to the wolf in a bukkit repository.

NO code from the gpl bukkit may be used in this project as it will force this project
to become gpl as well, unless it has been added by a copyright holder who releases the added code under LGPLv3

Now if ALL the copyright holders of Bukkit would pitch in and add the original code this would be done really soon and we can go back to making plugins.

Thank you for reading and possibly helping out.
