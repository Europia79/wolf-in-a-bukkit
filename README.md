wolf-in-a-bukkit
================

Wolf in a bukkit is intended to be an lgpl replacement for the gpl bukkit. 
To allow programs as craftbukkit and spigot to continue to exist.

To do this we will make a program that has same classes and method names to allow  compatiblity
but the code that handles the compatiblity will be different and original

NO code from the gpl bukkit may be used in this project as it will force this project
to become gpl as well.

If you commit to this project you transfer copyright of the written code to
the wolf in a bukkit project. This is to prevent any future mishaps.
If you wish to retain your copyright on your code you cannot contribute to this project
Feel free to make your own version though although we would prefer it if you would help
us with this.

Thank you for reading and possibly helping out.
